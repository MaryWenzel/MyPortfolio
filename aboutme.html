        <h2>Welcome! My name is Mary.</h2>
        <section class="sec1">
          I was born in 1993 into a family of eight.
          <p>
            I started my life as a dancer and have studied many dance forms
            throught my career. I went through my life mainly as a Ballet Dancer
            but as life goes on the world likes to throw us curveballs. As a
            lover of the arts, I try to express myself in anyway I can. I'm now
            jumping into the world of coding so I can expand on myself and the
            many things I will be able to create.
